DAAD Research Project and Past
==============================

Research project for my application to the DAAD short-term research grant (end of PhD).

Generate the pdf
----------------

You need `pandoc`, `make`, and a decent LaTeX distribution.

To build: `make`, and open `whitepaper.pdf`.

To build continuously (after every edit): install `inotify-tools` if you don't already have it, then `make watch`.
