DAAD Research project and other documents
=========================================

Research project and other documents (publications, planning) for my application to the DAAD short-term research grant (end of PhD).

Generate the pdfs
-----------------

You need `pandoc`, `make`, and a decent LaTeX distribution.

To build: `make`, and open the generated pdfs.

To build continuously (after every edit in the corresponding `.md` files): install `inotify-tools` if you don't already have it, then `make watch`.
